# local-wallet-deploy
This is repository where I have upload a local smart wallet. 

The project is build on a vyper smart contract, javascript and pyhon flask using it as the local server.

## Technology

* I used **Vyper** as my smart contract language.
* Javascript and HTML used for a simple front-end application for the user interaction with the blockchain.
* Python Flask used for a very simple local server so the user will be able to run **cmd** commands in the machine where the server runs.
* Last but not least for the Blockchain infrastraction I used **Foundry** tool chain, and more specifically:
      * **Anvil** so to create the lockal/test blockchain to our machine.
      * And **cast** command so to deploy our smart contract to our blockchain and to call some functions of our smart contract.
